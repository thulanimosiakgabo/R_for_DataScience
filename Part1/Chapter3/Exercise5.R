# Brainstorm at least 5 different ways to assess the typical delay characteristics of a group of flights. Consider the following scenarios:
#   
#   A flight is 15 minutes early 50% of the time, and 15 minutes late 50% of the time.
# 
# A flight is always 10 minutes late.
# 
# A flight is 30 minutes early 50% of the time, and 30 minutes late 50% of the time.
# 
# 99% of the time a flight is on time. 1% of the time itâ€™s 2 hours late.
# 
# Which is more important: arrival delay or departure delay?
#   
#   Come up with another approach that will give you the same output as not_cancelled %>% count(dest) and not_cancelled %>% count(tailnum, wt = distance) (without using count()).
# 
# Our definition of cancelled flights (is.na(dep_delay) | is.na(arr_delay) ) is slightly suboptimal. Why? Which is the most important column?
#   
#   Look at the number of cancelled flights per day. Is there a pattern? Is the proportion of cancelled flights related to the average delay?
#   
#   Which carrier has the worst delays? Challenge: can you disentangle the effects of bad airports vs. bad carriers? Why/why not? (Hint: think about flights %>% group_by(carrier, dest) %>% summarise(n()))
# 
# What does the sort argument to count() do. When might you use it?
